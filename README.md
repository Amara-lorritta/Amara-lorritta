Hi there! 👋 I'm Amarachi, an Ivy League graduate with dual Master's degrees in **Computer Information Science** and **International Development**.  
I am passionate about cloud technologies, continuous learning, and helping organizations succeed in their digital transformations.

While I don't come from a heavy coding background, I've been hands-on building cloud projects, mastering AWS and Azure foundational skills, and documenting my learning journey.
Open to collaborations, job opportunities, and mentorship in cloud security and related fields.
Fun fact: I have a beautiful singing voice and love to express myself through music!
